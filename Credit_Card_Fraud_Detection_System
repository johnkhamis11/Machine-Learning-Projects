# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

A Machine Learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms and advanced data preprocessing techniques.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses worldwide.  
The challenge lies in detecting fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced datasets where fraud cases represent only a small percentage of total transactions.

This project builds a classification model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false negatives.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- Highly imbalanced dataset
- Contains anonymized transaction features
- Target variable:
  - 0 → Legitimate transaction
  - 1 → Fraudulent transaction

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Data Exploration & Visualization  
2. Data Cleaning  
3. Handling Class Imbalance  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Evaluation

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Since fraud detection is a sensitive problem, the following metrics were used:

- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

Special focus was placed on **Recall**, to reduce false negatives.
