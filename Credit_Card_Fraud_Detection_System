💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent using supervised learning techniques.

📌 Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a major financial issue that leads to significant losses every year. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, detecting fraudulent transactions is challenging and requires careful preprocessing and evaluation.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

🧠 Model Approach

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling class imbalance

Training classification model

Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

📊 Results

The final model achieved strong fraud detection performance while minimizing false negatives, which is critical in fraud detection systems.
